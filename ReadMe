Object Classifier
The program will be able to determine what object is placed in front of the camera, wherein a web camera is used as the input device where the information coming from this device will be processed in order to achieve the first objective of the program.

The creators of this project would like to attain the following goals:

To identify what object is placed in front of the camera by detecting instances of objects from a particular class in an image. To be able to know and construct a system model for an object class from a set of training examples.

Scopes
The program will be able to detect what type of object is being fed to the camera. The program can only objects from a live web camera preview.

Delimitaions
The program does not allow images as inputs. The program cannot detect the colors of objects.

The following are the basic fundamental requirements needed in the project which is divided into two kinds of requirements, those being the interface requirements and regulatory requirements, respectively:
Interface Requirements
Accepts images as an entry.
Can detect the name of the objects.
Label the objects with its accurate name.
Regulatory Requirements
The object detector will limit the image used to a readable quality.
The text file will contain labels for detection.
The following are the basic non-fundamental requirements that are needed to be satisfied for the said program:
Web camera requirements:
The clarity which the camera will be able to detect the given image. Stable and non-moving/blurred image will be required. Specific resolution of the camera enables higher performance in image detection
