# USE CASE DIAGRAM

A use case diagram is a graphic depiction of the interactions among the elements of a system. 

A use case is a methodology used in system analysis to identify, clarify, and organize system requirements. In this context, the term "system" refers to something being developed or operated, such as a mail-order product sales and service Web site. Use case diagrams are employed in UML (Unified Modeling Language), a standard notation for the modeling of real-world objects and systems.

System objectives can include planning overall requirements, validating a hardware design, testing and debugging a software product under development, creating an online help reference, or performing a consumer-service-oriented task. For example, use cases in a product sales environment would include item ordering, catalog updating, payment processing, and customer relations. A use case diagram contains four components.

The boundary, which defines the system of interest in relation to the world around it.
The actors, usually individuals involved with the system defined according to their roles.
The use cases, which are the specific roles played by the actors within and around the system.
The relationships between and among the actors and the use cases.
A use case diagram looks something like a flowchart. Intuitive symbols represent the system elements. Here's a simple example:
