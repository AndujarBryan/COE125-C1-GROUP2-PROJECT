# **Object Detection Classifier in Windows 10**

## Purpose
The project is supposed to make use of the capabilities of modern machine along with a camera in order to process, learn, and identify an object on its own. By doing so, we would be able to provide a useful software in which it would be a great use for image processing and for projects that involves machine learning, face detection, and tracking.Â 

## Scope/s
The project does not work on mac OS and it might require a good laptop specification in order to work properly. The program can only accept live data as input and cannot process images for detection.

## Overview/s
The group would like to create a program that can detect an object and classify it with a label using TensorFlow, which is used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. The program will be written and implanted using Python. The program can only accept live data as input, which means that it cannot detect object when the input is an image.

## Basic Functional Requirement/s
- The program makes use of a camera. 
- It should be able to identify objects even if they are partially covered. 
- Must be able to learn new objects by giving it reference images for the program to learn. 
- The project should be scalable meaning additional hardware should be easy to integrate.

## Basic Non-Functional Requirement/s
- Must run on Windows or Linux with compatible hardware. 
- Implemented using Python.
